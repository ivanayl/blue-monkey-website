                <h1>Our History</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>The original store was established in May of 2002. It was named Wicks & Beans, as the original merchandise consisted mostly of scented candles and coffee beans. We were located at 2207 Murray Ave, also in Squirrel Hill (down and across from Mineo's Pizza.)</p>
                <p>Despite the small space, we expanded our assortments, eventually also selling teas and international sweets. Well, it was getting tight, so we were very happy to move to a much larger space at 5872 Forbes Ave in July of 2006 and change the name of the store to Margaret's Fine Imports.</p>
                <p>Since then we've become mostly a tea specialty store with over 400 varieties of teas in stock, and a huge assortment of teapots and tea gadgets. We even sell items like tea cozies and tea wallets! We also carry over 30 types of coffee beans and some neat coffee makers! Apart from that we also attend to the sweet tooth of our customers by stocking up on international sweets, especially around the holidays and we offer tea classes and tea tastings every month. On May 9th, 2017 we opened a store in Carnegie and changed both store names to Blue Monkey Tea. The Carnegie PA location has since moved to Pittsburgh in February of 2019.</p>
                <p>We offer excellent service and we enjoy interacting with our customers: repeat and new! Whose a good Blue Monkey Tea? We are a good Blue Monkey Tea! And we are here to serve you!</p>
